# Intelligent Document Parsing
## What It Is

Intelligent Document Parsing is a smart, AI-powered service that automatically reads and extracts data from any uploaded document — such as passports, tickets, invoices, or IDs — and generates structured, ready-to-use form fields for your web applications.

We are a service provider that helps businesses eliminate tedious form-filling processes.
If your website requires users to manually enter large amounts of information, our system can do it instantly and accurately.

Imagine uploading a passport, boarding pass, or any official document — and instantly getting all the relevant fields (like Name, Date of Birth, Document Number, etc.) extracted and pre-filled for you.

You don’t even need to tell us what document it is!
Our intelligent engine automatically identifies the document type and extracts all key fields on the spot.

✅ Just upload and let the system do the work

For example, when you upload a flight ticket, our system automatically extracts:

✈️ Boarding Airport & City
🛬 Destination Airport & City
📅 Boarding & Departure Date & Time
🧍 Passenger Name
🎫 Flight Number
…and displays them neatly in structured form fields ready for integration.
